description: General information about what the angular package provides.

# Introduction

The documentation provides general information about **angular-package** features.

In a few sentences, angular-package supports the **development** process of [**angular**](https://angular.io)-based applications in varied ways through the thoughtful, reusable, easy-to-use small pieces of code called packages.

Some of them are designed in a **business logic** way for **intuitive** exchange data between database and user interface and by having a mind in the **simplicity** of the javascript-typescript integration.

Some of the functionalities are based on **non-conventional** javascript usage resulting from the use of primitive wrapper objects to achieve specific-purpose immutable types with **intuitive** names and their **unique** features.

An **angular package** contains objects like range, preferences, user, settings to build an **intuitive user interface**, and on the next page, there is a list of them, even those currently unavailable.
