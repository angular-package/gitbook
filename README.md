# Introduction

The designing page describes small parts of the designing process functions, objects, classes, and more. Shows various ways of thinking, which means problems that arose during the process, and their possible solutions.

Of course, before starting, there is a need to know what will be designed and its basis.

### Idea

It's called an **idea**, and every **idea** brings problems. Finding solutions to those problems is a part of the process, which it's not possible until there is a **clear idea** of what the problem is. To have a **clear idea** means to make a thorough analysis, and to do it properly, general and specific-idea knowledge is required.

### Problem

The **problem**, better to say, the **challenge** is to write meaningful, clearly-understandable, easy-readable code in an **intuitive**, **minimal**, **logical**, **cohesive**, and **consistent** way. Writing code that considers many word definitions can be frustrating or difficult without a list of rules. Investing the time to create a few design **principles** saves time in the design process and results in a **thoughtful** final form.

### Principles

To make **thoughtful** design **principles** there is a need to make a **deeper** **insight** into many **things** around the code and into the **code**, achieving appropriate **integration** of those **things** with a code. It means to put **effort** to make much **analysis** of different things and make a proper final **diagnose**. One of the **things** is to choose the right words and **proper understanding** of the words used to produce the code.&#x20;

### Words

Designing process forces to know the definitions of some words and a proper understanding of them, which results in better insight and final form of objects. To make things easier on the next page are definitions of some words good to know.
