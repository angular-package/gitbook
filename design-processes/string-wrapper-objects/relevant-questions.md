# Relevant questions

The general definition of the words [**intuitive**](../../definitions/intuitive-adjective.md) and [**consistent**](../../definitions/consistent-adjective.md) is explained in the definition section, and it seems clear. There is a need to combine these two words with a method and answer relevant questions to understand the combination of the method's [intuitiveness](../../definitions/intuitiveness-noun.md) and [consistency](../../definitions/consistency-noun.md).

During reading the following questions, your mind should form new thoughts of different perspectives.

1. **What does it mean the method name is** [**intuitive**](../../definitions/intuitive-adjective.md)**?**\
   The method name is intuitive when its name is understandable at first sight and cohesive to functionality.\

2. **What does it mean the method name is** [**consistent**](../../definitions/consistent-adjective.md)**?**\
   The method name is consistent when coded in generally known naming conventions intuitively and cohesively to its functionality.\

3. **What does it mean the method is** [**intuitive**](../../definitions/intuitive-adjective.md)**?**\
   ****The method is intuitive when its functionality is consistent and cohesive to its name.\

4. **What does it mean the method is** [**consistent**](../../definitions/consistent-adjective.md)**?**\
   The method is consistent when it behaves in the same intuitive-functional way cohesive to its name. It means always performing the same action like it sets or gets something in different objects despite some differences.

These are simple explanations because intuitive and consistent words are interdependent, giving different results from different perspectives of the insight.

Let's do some **investigation** having in a mind explanation above.
