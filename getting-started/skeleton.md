# Skeleton

The package was generated by the [library skeleton](https://github.com/angular-package/skeleton) which was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.0.&#x20;

Copy package to the `packages/type` folder of the [library skeleton](https://github.com/angular-package/skeleton) then run the commands below.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project type` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project type`.

> Note: Don't forget to add `--project type` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

### Build

Run `ng build type` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### **Publishing**

After building your library with `ng build type`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/type` and run `npm publish`.

### **Running unit tests**

Before the test can be performed install `@angular-package/testing` with command:&#x20;

```bash
npm i @angular-package/testing --no-save
```

Run `ng test type` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
