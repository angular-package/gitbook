# Overview

## `TypeError {}`

The `TypeError` object is an extension of the [`CommonError`](broken-reference) class and is thrown when an operation could not be performed, typically(but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type, with the message built from the described problem and its solution, optional an explicit identification and type, on the given or stored template.
